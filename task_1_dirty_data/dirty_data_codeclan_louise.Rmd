## Data Cleaning
```{r}
This data has row formats; how to get rid of them
This data isnâ€™t tidy.
You will want better column header names.
```

```{r}
# reading in data
decathalon_data <- read_rds("decathlon.rds")

#add here
```

```{r}
head(decathalon_data)
```


```{r}
# removing row names


decathalon_data$names <- c("Serble", "Clay", "Karpov", "Bernard", "Yurkov",
                           "Warners", "Zsivoczky", "McMullen", "Martineau", 
                           "Hernu", "Barras", "Nool", "Bouguignon", "Serble",
                           "Clay", "Karpov", "Macey", "Warners", "Zsivoczky",
                           "Hernu", "Nool", "Bernard", "Schwarzl", "Pogorelov",

```{r}
# clean column names

clean_decathalon <- clean_names(clean_decathalon)

clean_decathalon <- decathalon_data %>%
  relocate(names, .before = "100m")
```

```{r}
# several still start with x
#go through these again
clean_decathalon <- clean_decathalon %>%
  rename("110m_hurdle" = "x110m.hurdle",
         "1500m" = "x1500m",

               values_to = "winner_of_competition") %>%
   pivot_wider(names_from = competition,
              values_from = winner_of_competition)

```


```{r}
# Analysis questions
# 
# Who had the longest long jump seen in the data?
# What was the average 100m time in each competition?
# Who had the highest total points across both competitions?
# What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?
# What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?

```
