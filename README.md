## dirty_data project task1 decathalon

This is a dataset with results from two decathalon competitions, the Decastar 
which is an annual French competition, organised by World Athletics,
and the Olympics which is organised by the IOC. 

This is project where a range of questions have been set, and the data has been cleaned.

On the raw data, the following steps have been completed to clean the data:
- Moving the names from the row names, and into a column for names.
- Deleting the row names.
- Moving the row names column to the front of the dataset.
- Cleaning all the column names using janitor.
- Manually cleaning the remaining column names, by manually renaming them.
- Pivoting the table.
- Saved to csv.

All questions set have been answered. 
These are:
Who had the longest long jump seen in the data?
What was the average 100m time in each competition?
Who had the highest total points across both competitions?
What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?
What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?
